Sample Selection Module for IACT (Importance-Aware Co-Teaching) Algorithm

This module implements the co-teaching sample selection mechanism where two policies
teach each other by selecting high-quality samples based on importance weights and
policy confidence scores.

Key Components:
- SampleSelector: Main class for coordinating sample selection between dual policies
- CoTeachingScheduler: Manages selection rates and curriculum learning
- SampleQualityMetrics: Computes quality scores for sample selection
- BatchSelector: Utilities for efficient batch-wise sample selection

Mathematical Foundation:
- Sample quality score: Q(s,a) = w(s) * Ï€(a|s) * confidence(s,a)
- Selection criterion: Top-k samples with highest quality scores
- Curriculum learning: Gradually decrease selection rate from high to low
