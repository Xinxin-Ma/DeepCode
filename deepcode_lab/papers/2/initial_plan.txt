I'll create a comprehensive reproduction plan by analyzing the paper content directly. Let me read the markdown file and synthesize the information from both analyses.

```python
# Read the paper content directly
paper_dir = "/mnt/d/Xinxin/Codes/DeepCode/deepcode_lab/papers/2"
import os

# Let me check what's available and read the paper
try:
    files = os.listdir(paper_dir)
    print(f"Files in directory: {files}")
    
    # Find and read the markdown file
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith('.md'):
            with open(os.path.join(paper_dir, file), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                paper_content = f.read()
            break
    
    print(f"Paper length: {len(paper_content)} characters")
    print("=== PAPER CONTENT PREVIEW ===")
    print(paper_content[:3000])
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Based on the comprehensive analyses provided, I'll create a complete reproduction plan for the "Importance-Aware Co-Teaching for Offline Reinforcement Learning" paper:

  # SECTION 2: Implementation Components
  implementation_components: |
    
    ## Core Algorithm: IACT (algorithms/iact.py)
    **Purpose**: Main algorithm integrating importance estimation and co-teaching
    **Key Components**:
    - State importance estimation via KLIEP density ratio
    - Dual policy architecture with co-teaching mechanism
    - Sample selection based on importance weights and policy confidence
    - Behavior cloning regularization to prevent OOD actions
    
    **Mathematical Formulations**:
    - Importance weight: w(s) = π(s)/β(s) where π is policy distribution, β is behavior distribution
    - KLIEP objective: max_α Σᵢ log(Σⱼ αⱼK(sᵢ, sⱼ)) subject to Σᵢ αᵢ = 1, αᵢ ≥ 0
    - Co-teaching selection: Select top-k samples with highest w(s) * confidence(a|s)
    - BC regularizer: λ_BC * KL(π(·|s), π_β(·|s))
    
    ## Importance Estimator (algorithms/importance_estimator.py)
    **Purpose**: Density ratio estimation using Kullback-Leibler Importance Estimation Procedure
    **Implementation Details**:
    - Gaussian RBF kernels: K(s, s') = exp(-||s - s'||²/(2σ²))
    - Kernel centers: Random subset of dataset states
    - Optimization: Convex optimization to find kernel weights α
    - Output: Importance weights w(s) for each state in dataset
    
    **Class Structure**:
    ```python
    class ImportanceEstimator:
        def __init__(self, kernel_type='rbf', n_kernels=100, sigma=1.0)
        def fit(self, policy_states, behavior_states)
        def estimate_weights(self, states)
        def _build_kernel_matrix(self, X, Y)
        def _solve_kliep_optimization(self, kernel_matrix)
    ```
    
    ## Co-Teaching Framework (algorithms/sample_selector.py)
    **Purpose**: Sample selection mechanism where two policies teach each other
    **Key Logic**:
    - Policy A selects samples for Policy B based on importance weights and A's confidence
    - Policy B selects samples for Policy A based on importance weights and B's confidence
    - Selection rate: Start high (0.8) and gradually decrease to prevent overfitting
    - Sample quality metric: w(s) * π(a|s) (importance weight × policy probability)
    
    ## Neural Network Architectures (models/)
    
    ### Actor Networks (models/actor.py):
    - **Architecture**: 3-layer MLP [state_dim, 256, 256, action_dim]
    - **Activation**: ReLU for hidden layers, tanh for output layer
    - **Output**: Mean and log_std for continuous actions (Gaussian policy)
    - **Regularization**: Layer normalization, dropout (0.1)
    
    ### Critic Networks (models/critic.py):
    - **Architecture**: Double Q-learning with two Q-networks
    - **Network**: 3-layer MLP [state_dim + action_dim, 256, 256, 1]
    - **Activation**: ReLU throughout
    - **Target Networks**: Polyak averaging with τ = 0.005
    
    ## Training Pipeline (training/)
    
    ### Main Trainer (training/trainer.py):
    **Training Loop Structure**:
    1. Initialize dual policies (A, B) and critics (QA, QB)
    2. Estimate state importance weights using KLIEP
    3. For each epoch:
       - Policy A selects samples for Policy B training
       - Update Policy B and Critic B on selected samples
       - Policy B selects samples for Policy A training
       - Update Policy A and Critic A on selected samples
       - Update target networks
       - Log metrics and selection rates
    
    ### Co-Teaching Logic (training/co_teacher.py):
    **Sample Selection Algorithm**:
    ```python
    def select_samples(self, policy, importance_weights, batch, selection_rate):
        # Compute policy confidence for each sample
        log_probs = policy.log_prob(batch['actions'])
        confidence_scores = torch.exp(log_probs)
        
        # Combine importance weights with confidence
        selection_scores = importance_weights * confidence_scores
        
        # Select top-k samples
        k = int(len(batch) * selection_rate)
        top_k_indices = torch.topk(selection_scores, k).indices
        
        return self.create_selected_batch(batch, top_k_indices)
    ```
